# EncLang

**Pseudo-Latin Encrypted Language**

An encryption algorithm that outputs ciphertext resembling a human languageâ€”made of pronounceable, consistent, and structured syllables.

This "encrypted language" might have:

 - Defined syllables (e.g., CV or CVC structures like la, tor, zim)
 - Grammatically plausible sentence structures A dictionary of
 - pseudo-words that map to encrypted data
 - Rules to make it look like it could be spoken

The files included are the encryption and decryption Python code.

**There are two options:**
ChaCha-Poly1305 with auth - gives longer output
AES version uses AES-CTR (no auth) - gives shorter output
